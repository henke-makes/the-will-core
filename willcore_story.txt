The mysterious artefact known as the Will Core went missing
from the college of Mages in Coderia ten years ago, stolen by
The League of Musical Villainy. There was no trace as to its
whereabouts until recently, when the Mages picked up its vibes
from a dungeon which turns out to be the League's hideout.
A Knight of the realm has been tasked by the King of Coderia, 
the mighty Lord Hengun, to retrieve this holy object to its rightful,
i.e. most recent, owner.

The journey to the Lair of Musical Villainy is long and perilous.
We won't be playing that part though, don't worry. It went fine.
As you step towards the gate of their dungeon, you feel the pull of
the Will Core.

If you reach it, you will succeed this day!
Else you will fall and the Will Core will be lost forever.
