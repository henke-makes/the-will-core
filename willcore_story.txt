The mysterious artefact known as the Will Core has gone missing
from the college of Mages in Coderia. The League of Musical
Villainy are surely behind this rotten deed! A Knight of
the realm has been tasked by the King of Coderia, the mighty Lord 
Hengun, to retrieve this holy object to its rightful,
i.e. most recent, owner.

The journey to the Lair of Musical Villainy is long and perilous.
We won't be playing that part though, don't worry. It went fine.
As you step towards the gate of their dungeon, you feel the pull of
the Will Core.

If you reach it, you will succeed this day!
Else you will fall and the Will Core will be lost forever.
