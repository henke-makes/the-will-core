---------------------------------------------------------------------
The mysterious artefact known as the Will Core has gone missing
from the college of Mages in Coderia. The dastardly villains
Opera Tor and Funk Sean are behind this rotten deed! You are
a knight of the realm, and you have been tasked by the King to
retrieve this holy object to its rightful, i.e. most recent, owner.

The journey to the lair of the musical villains is long and perilous.
We won't be playing that part though, don't worry.
As you step towards the gate of their dungeon, you feel the pull of
the Will Core.

If you reach it, you will succeed this day!
Else you will fall and the Will Core will be lost forever.
